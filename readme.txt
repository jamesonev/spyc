#GETTING STARTED
5 sample programs have been provided.



make test1 output:
while(1 )
{
x = 1 
}
foo (a , b , 2 + 4 )
function 
myFunction (x , y )
{
if(x > 300000 )
{
return
x }
x = x * y 
y = x % y 
z = myFunction (x , y )

return
z 




make test2 output:
a = 0 + 4 * 2 
b = 10 
function 
foo (a , b )
{
c = a + b 
return
c + 5 
}
foo (1 , 30 )
while(1 < b & a + b > 6 )
{
x = "aboaisnroubas" 
y = x & "whoareyou" 
z = z + 1 


}
return
z 





make test3 output:
while(yatouastuyahtsyounbaato" < 2 )
{
